So you've found someone to buy your old Mac, and now you've got to clear off your data.

Here's how I prep my Macs for sale in less than 5 minutes. No Recovery Partition necessary.

## Open System Preferences and Create a New Administrator User

The first step is to create a new user with Administrator rates.

Open System Preferences. Click on Users. Unlock to allow changes. Hit the + button to create a new user with Administrator rights.

## Log Out and Switch to Your New User

The next step is to delete your old user account.

Log out. Log in to your new administrator user.

## Open System Preferences and Delete Your Old Account

Open System Preferences. Click on Users. Select your old account, and click the minus button.

I'm assuming you already have a backup, so click on Delete the home folder, and check the Erase home folder securely.

**Important:** You are securely erasing your account. If you do not have a backup, you will lose everything. You do keep backups, right? Go double check it before deleting your account.

## Bonus Step: Securely Erase Empty Hard Drive Space

Open Disk Utility. Select your Macintosh HD partition. Select the Erase tab. Click Erase Free Space. You can choose from 3 options ranging from Fastest to Most Secure.

## Congratulations, Your Computer is Ready

After completing this walkthrough, you have a fresh user with the default settings, and you have securely wiped your personal data.

Nice work.
