Beginning with the iPad Air in November of 2013, T-Mobile began offering a free 200MB/mo data plan for iPad owners.

While great for iPad Air owners, this is also exciting news because the same plan works on any LTE enabled iPad. The Verizon and AT&T iPads both come unlocked, so all you have to do is get a T-Mobile SIM card to take advantage.

T-Mobile's data is great in some areas, and not-so-great in most. But if you live in an area where T-Mobile has LTE or HSPA+, this is worth checking out.

## Step 1: Order a T-Mobile SIM Card

First step is to pick up a T-Mobile SIM card. You can do so online at T-Mobile.com.

## Step 2: Replace Your Old AT&T or Verizon SIM Card

Our next step is to replace the AT&T or Verizon SIM card with the new one from T-Mobile. Find a paperclip to eject the SIM card on your iPad casing.

Your iPad will notify you that there is No SIM Card Installed, as pictured:

## Step 3: Insert Your New T-Mobile SIM Card

Place the new T-Mobile SIM card into the tray and insert it into your iPad. Wait a few moments while the iPad activates the SIM card, and you'll get a T-Mobile signal as pictured below.

## Step 4: Set Up Your T-Mobile SIM Card Account

Open up Safari and navigate to any page. You will be redirected to the T-Mobile Mobile Internet Management account system. Set up a new account (FREE!), and you'll be all set.

## Step 5: Enjoy Your Free 200MB/mo

200MB/mo isn't going to let you stream Netflix or Spotify, but it is plenty to check e-mail, Twitter, and surf the web when you don't have Wi-Fi.

If you need more data, you can buy more from T-Mobile, or quickly swap your AT&T or Verizon card back into the iPad and use either of those.

Have fun!
