Most of us can point to an era that defines us. Maybe it was the time, or place, or the people that surrounded us. Maybe we didn't even realize it at the time, but the experience was shaping our personality, our values, our very future. Maybe it was coincidence that we were there, or maybe it was the result of very conscious decisions by people who love us. But we can point back, recognizing that our lives would not be what they are without that experience.
