Pauline Hawkins has gotten some attention in recent weeks because of her public resignation letter titled [Why I'm Resigning After 11 Years as a Teacher][http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pauline-hawkins/my-resignation-letter-teaching_b_5160721.html?&ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000023]. 

It comes across as a classic case of burnout, an all-too-common problem in the world of education.

>I know I have made a difference in the lives of my students, just as they have irrevocably changed mine. Teaching is the most rewarding job I have ever had. That is why I am sad to leave the profession I love.

When the problems in teaching overpower the 'made a difference' part of teaching, that's burnout.

Her reasons, in order, are as follows:

1. Leaving to be closer to family
2. Colorado's low salary
3. Cultural shifts with negative results pinned on No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top
4.
