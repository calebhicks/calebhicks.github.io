Learning is an interesting thing. The way we learn has shifted from lectures in classrooms to connecting and interacting with experts around the world.

Here's an example. During Spring Break last week my wife decided that she wanted to repaint the entire house and create a project room. This would involve me installing a couple of electrical outlets, mounting the TV in the living room, and building a desk.

I'm a geek, not a contractor. I hadn't the foggiest idea how to install an electrical outlet. Before 6 months ago, I'd never used a saw. My experience with tools was using a screwdriver to build a computer, and a hammer to... nail things?
