tweet: "UDOT's Super Bowl commercial is controversial by design."
---

Local news organization [KSL reports][1] on the controversy surrounding the UDOT commercial that played during the super bowl:

>Despite the intended message urging people to use their seat belts every time they get into a car, a number of people have criticized the commercial, saying it is not appropriate for children to see.

Pushing you to have a tough discussion about the realities of seat belt use with your 4 and 7 year olds is **exactly** what this commercial was designed to do. If your child is upset about it, have the discussion, and decide as a family that this isn't going to happen to you.

I had 2 good friends die from car accidents while I was in elementary school. Children dying in accidents without seat belts[^1] is a harsh reality, and I applaud anything that increases dialogue and awareness, especially if it ends up saving a life.

>We really wanted to spark some conversation between families and maybe inspire someone who hasnâ€™t worn their seat belt to start doing so.

Brilliant. Mission accomplished.
