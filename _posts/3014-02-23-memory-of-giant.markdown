It was a warm day in early August. The morning sun beamed over the dashboard of the car as the air conditioner warmed up for a few hours of exercise. Jars of Clay played over the stereo. I stared back at the rock and iron gate enclosing my summer home until it disappeared behind the low hills of North Fork Road knowing that this was the end of an era.

It was another fresh summer day, 6 years earlier, that was to mark my first full-time adventure at Clear Creek Ranch, a cattle ranch turned family reunion resort by the enterprising James Bodell and his four daughters, as a postlude to a long career in industrial construction with his four sons. 

Emotions ran high that day. I was finally old enough to join my cousins in running the resort alongside James, my grandpa. A summer of hard work, play, and new experiences. 

I say was, because when in my youthful excitement to drive, I ended up breaking my leg when the cart tilted off of a 15 foot ramp. This was the first of three vehicles I would destroy in my years there. 

James Huggard Bodell went through life as a simple man. A pioneer of his profession, and a patriarch of his posterity. 





Notes:

A moment long since forgiven, but not forgotten only for repeated apologies a decade hence.
