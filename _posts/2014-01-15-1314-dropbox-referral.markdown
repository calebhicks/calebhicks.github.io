tweet: I have over 100 students registering for Dropbox tomorrow. Need referrals to bolster your account?
---

Each semester I have over 100 students create new Dropbox accounts. I've used this to max out my Dropbox referrals, and have also done so with a number of close friends.

This year, I'm opening it up a little bit. I can probably help max out 5-10 of you on your referral credits for Dropbox. 

If you are interested, send me an [@reply][1] on Twitter with your Dropbox referral link, and while you're there, give me a follow. I talk tech, business, and education.

Cheers.

**Update**: I got more than enough for class tomorrow. I'll post again next time I'm getting classes set up. Thanks for the feedback everyone!
