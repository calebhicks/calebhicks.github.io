After spending the last 15 months at Apple working on the [Everyone Can Code](https://apple.com/everyone-can-code/) program, bringing Swift and App Development training into high schools, colleges, and enterprise, I’ve got something big to announce.

Earlier today, I started in my new role over instruction at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com), a new YC-backed six month online computer science program that’s free for students until they get a job. And I could not be more excited. Check out the website if you want to learn more.

I’ve gotten more questions about this than previous career changes, so I wanted to recap a few of the reasons why I’d leave a job almost perfectly tailored to my background and interests at a company I love for another startup.

**First**, to do right by my family. We loved our experience in the Bay Area, but we are thrilled to return home to Utah surrounded by friends, family, and gorgeous mountains. I mean, just look at them.

**Second**, to get back into my interests and hobbies. Working at Apple has many benefits, but I've missed being a part of developer, open source, and local startup communities. I've missed working on side projects and freelance work. I've missed freely commenting on Apple and other tech stories, and speaking at events or conferences. All of these are an important part of my psyche, identity, and career satisfaction. (Relatedly, we’ll be shipping [Wired In](http://wearewiredin.com) very soon.)

**Third**, to start something new that has the chance to change the world. On a micro level, I’ll get to work more directly with students working to change their lives. On a macro level, we’re proving a new model of education that puts student success over profits. If you work in a one-size-fits-all school that fails to empower students with real-world skills, or you profit off of student debt, we’re coming for you.

With the number of jobs that will be displaced by technology, including machine learning, artificial intelligence, and self-driving vehicles, I believe that adult retraining is the most important social challenge we face over the next decade. 

I’m ridiculously excited to get started.
