I've been on the outskirts of web development for the better part of 15 years. I've built websites, I've managed servers, I've done side projects. If you take the entire population, I'm probably in the 98th percentile of experience with web development. 

Which basically means I don't know anything. 

I've spent a decade and a half dipping my toes into this practice. And now it's time for me to dive in. Sink or swim. And I'm writing today to invite you to join me.

The [DevMountain](https://devmounta.in/?r=VOM ) Web Core boot camp begins on May 6th, promising to introduce students to building their own web apps using Node, Express, Angular, etc. The 12 week course takes place on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights from 6-9pm and Saturdays from 9am-2pm. 

## 12 Intense Weeks of Pure Code

This course isn't for those who want to dabble or experiment. It's a 12 week boot camp. Sure, the classes are at night, so it's convenient for those of us who have full-time jobs. But if all you do is show up to class, you won't get much out of it. Every bit of additional effort will pay huge dividends.

As a teacher, I get summers off. So this is a great time for me to really get deep into this stuff.

## It's not cheap. But it is.

Tuition starts at $3900 for the web core, or $4500 for the newly announced iOS core. This isn't a $39 ebook or $25 video series. There are teachers, mentors, a professional learning network to continue learning once the class is over. There is face-to-face discussions, code reviews, and Q&A time. And as a reward for those willing to make the cash and time investments required, DevMountain has a 95% placement rate for those wanting to get development jobs.

You know what the average junior developer in Utah is getting paid right now? $3900 is a great investment.

## So are you leaving teaching?

Not now. No. While the 2x salary is intriguing, I enjoy what I do too much to bail on it right now. I wake up excited to go to work. I get to work with kids wanting to learn technology and entrepreneurship, two things I *love*. I'm working on a Digital Citizenship program to get kids more involved with creating, connecting, and sharing online. I get 2 weeks off for Christmas, a week for Spring Break, and 2.5 months in the summer. I get to make a difference every day.

I'm not ready to give that up.

## So why are you doing it again?

I want to learn this stuff. I want to be able to build functional prototypes of ideas I have. I want to get to know more people in this space. I want to be able to tell students more about what's out there. Who knows, maybe I'll end up teaching it at the junior high sometime [^1].

## You Said 'Come Learn With Me'...

Yes. I learn better when I know people who are in the trenches with me. So I want anyone and everyone I know to come join me at DevMountain this summer. We can learn to build stuff together.

Oh, and if you use this special link to register, I get a little bit of a kickback on my tuition, and I'll use the savings to take us both to a nice dinner:

Maybe you're already signed up for DevMountain, but we don't know each other yet. We should meet up! E-mail me, hit me up on Twitter, let's do lunch. I'd love to know someone before the first day of class.
