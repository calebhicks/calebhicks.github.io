I am Caleb Hicks. I teach technology, business, and entrepreneurship to teenagers at [Lehi Junior High School][8] in Utah. I am advisor for the local FBLA chapter, and coach the 9th grade basketball team.

This blog is home to various walkthroughs, insights, and commentary that I feel is worth sharing. This will be home to longer-form pieces. I share links on [Pinboard][1] and [Twitter][2].

I write this site using [Markdown][3], processed into static HTML by [Jekyll][4], and hosted on [Amazon S3][5]. The theme is called Way Away, and is available from [Statiq][6], a project I am involved with that began at a [Startup Weekend][7] in November of 2013.
