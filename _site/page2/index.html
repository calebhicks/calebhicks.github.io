	<p>No talk, all action. Launch a startup in 54 hours.</p>

<p>That’s the mission of <a href="http://startupweekend.org">Startup Weekend</a>, a global event focused on building communities of entrepreneurs.</p>

<h2 id="my-startup-weekend-experience">My Startup Weekend Experience</h2>

<p>I went to my first Startup Weekend in November hosted at the beautiful Weber State <a href="http://www.startupogden.com/">Startup Ogden</a> extension. I worked with an awesome team, including <a href="http://twitter.com/jkhowland">Joshua Howland</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/a_harris88">Adam Harris</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/cwoodcox">Corey Woodcox</a>, and many of the great people at <a href="http://builtbyhq.com">HQ</a>. We worked on <a href="http://statiq.io">Statiq</a>, helping people build beautiful, ridiculously fast websites using static blogging engines. </p>

<p>In one weekend we were able to build our first two themes, a beta web interface for managing your site, an iOS app for the same purpose, and a syncing engine for hosting your static HTML blog on AWS using nothing more than text files inside of a Dropbox folder.</p>

<p>And, in an eye-opening launch<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, we sold over $1000 worth of memberships our last evening of the weekend.</p>

<h2 id="startup-weekend-provo">Startup Weekend Provo</h2>

<p>I met so many cool people and had such a great time at my first Startup Weekend, I decided I wouldn’t miss another one if it were nearby. So, even though my (for another 72ish hours) unborn son will be only 3 weeks old, my wife has graciously given me permission to head to Provo for the event.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in meeting other awesome people in the Utah technology or startup communities, you can do much worse than Startup Weekend Provo. I’ll be there. A couple of my students will be there. And so will a hundred or more other really stellar people from around the state.</p>

<h2 id="my-personal-invitation">My Personal Invitation</h2>

<p>I’m going to pitch my first idea this time around. Everyone that attends gets the opportunity to invite people to their project, and the top 10 or so projects continue working through the weekend. I don’t know if my idea will be one of those 10 that get selected, and if not, I’ll find something else cool to work on.</p>

<p>I’ll be pitching my idea for an education tipline. You know those banners at football games that say ‘Text 55555 for assistance or to report an incident’? That, but for middle and high schools. I live in this world every day, and while it’s not the next billion dollar darling, I am confident that there is a problem worth solving here, and I have all of the connections to local prospects so that we can build the right solution.</p>

<p>If you’re into, or interested in learning about any of the following, I’d love to see you at Startup Weekend:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Backend development (Rails, Django, Node, whatever)</li>
  <li>Frontend design (Photoshop, Bootstrap, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, etc)</li>
  <li>Twilio</li>
  <li>Stripe</li>
</ol>

<p>And even if you aren’t, or you want to work on something else, you should come out to Startup Weekend just for the experience. It’s a great time with great people. And if you’re into tech or startups, I can guarantee an experience you won’t forget<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Early Bird registration ends today. It’s $49. It goes up to $75 up until the event begins on February 20th. Find out more details or get your ticket at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/provo-startup-weekend-022014-tickets-10073172129?">EventBrite</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re going, interested in going, or have any questions before registering, shoot me a message on <a href="http://twitter.com/calebhicks">Twitter</a>. I love hearing from and working with other tech and startup people in Utah.</p>

	</header>
	<p>I have a volunteer helping out a couple of days each week in my classroom. We are working with students to prepare for FBLA’s Desktop Publishing competition, and she was demonstrating Photoshop to create a menu for our school store. </p>

<p>As she walked through the tools, I kept wondering why she was doing things in her specific way. For example, filling marquee rectangles instead of the rectangle tool. But when she finished, she had created something much better than I would have. And even more important, so had many of the students she was teaching. </p>

<p>Technique, skill, and experience are great. They are multipliers. But work is the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/multiplicand?s=t">multiplicand</a>. When you have work and talent, magic happens. But if you can only have one, take the work. The novice who shows up and puts in work will trump the lazy guru. </p>

<p>We just completed our $5 Weekend activity in my Teen Entrepreneurship class. The students are given $5 seed money and 48 hours to make as much money as they can <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Students sold candy, cleaned homes, baked cookies, even sold thrift shop finds on eBay. During our breakdown discussion, I asked the students what they learned:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I need money, I can make it. But <em>I have to go and do something</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.</p>

		<h1> <a href="/2014/first-world-problems-monetize/"> First World Problems Can Still Be Monetized</a></h1>
		<time datetime="2014-01-28T14:34:52Z">January 28, 2014</time>
	</header>
	<p>I taught my students about how to brainstorm business ideas today. We focused on looking for problems in need of a solution, and that great entrepreneurs are always looking for problems to solve.</p>

<p>We first talked about solutions that seem obvious now, but weren’t when they were first introduced - the car, the cell phone, breakfast cereal. We talked about primary and secondary ‘problems’ that products can solve. For example, how the car can be much more than a transportation solution; a pastime, a butt warmer, a status symbol.</p>

<p>But then we started to get into more contemporary ideas. We looked at social media: Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. </p>

<p>Helping college kids with an easier way to connect online? Letting you send self-destructing photos to others? 140 character microblogs?</p>

<p>A student raised his hand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aren’t these super first-world problems?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, they are. Not every business has to solve problems for the second or third worlds. In fact, most businesses don’t. People will happily pay for something that solves a minor annoyance. Here are the tips I gave to the class, from a post by <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/two-problems/">Chris Guillebeau</a> in April of last year:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A solution to a problem</li>
  <li>A response to a clear need</li>
  <li>Something that makes people happier</li>
  <li>Something that removes a negative</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s awesome if you can solve world hunger, cure disease, or dig wells for clean water. These missions for humanity need our world’s brightest minds. But most businesses today are solving first world problems. For better or worse, it’s a natural result of people with first world incomes being able to pay for solutions to first world problems.</p>

<p>Don’t shy away from solving ‘first world problems’. People are happy to pay for the right solution.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Because they monetize eyeballs and impressions, they aren’t exactly models of monetizing first world problems directly, but great examples of building multibillion dollar businesses around first world problems. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

	<p>Each semester I have over 100 students create new Dropbox accounts. I’ve used this to max out my Dropbox referrals, and have also done so with a number of close friends.</p>

<p>This year, I’m opening it up a little bit. I can probably help max out 5-10 of you on your referral credits for Dropbox. </p>

<p>If you are interested, send me an <a href="http://twitter.com/calebhicks">@reply</a> on Twitter with your Dropbox referral link, and while you’re there, give me a follow. I talk tech, business, and education.</p>

		<h1> <a href="/2014/responding-to-failure/"> Taking Chances and Being OK With Failure</a></h1>
		<time datetime="2014-01-08T19:29:09Z">January 08, 2014</time>
	</header>
	<p>Everyone fails. But it’s not the failure that defines you, it’s how you respond. </p>

<p>I coach the 9th grade boys basketball team at my school. We’ve worked together for three months to get better. Today the boys faced a talented team in a winnable game. Starting down by 15 in the second quarter, they fought back to within one late in the game. They had two looks in the last ten seconds to pull out a victory and missed both shots. </p>

<p>Failure.</p>

<p>But as a coach, I’m OK with failure. It’s a learning opportunity. It’s a stepping stone towards greatness. Remember, it’s how you respond to failure that defines you. </p>

<p>Those kids could have given up after the first quarter. Or after one was shoved into the wall by a guy 6 inches and 100 pounds bigger. Or when one was forced to foul out of the game with 3.5 seconds left. But not these kids. They secured a rebound and got another <em>good</em> opportunity before time expired. </p>

<p>They fought back. They didn’t give up. When the odds were against them, they kept going. </p>

<h2 id="how-about-afterwards">How about afterwards?</h2>

<p>As the player who took the last two shots walked off the court, upset with his performance, his teammates corralled him, let him know they were glad he took those shots. He turned to a teammate and said, “let’s get better.”</p>

<p>Failure is a prevalent force in sports, in education, in startups. But if we work hard to get there, and take it as a learning lesson afterwards, we turn failure into a step on the bridge to success. </p>

<h2 id="the-failure-resume">The Failure Resume</h2>

<p>Tina Seelig, author of What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20, and Stanford professor, invites her students to create a Failure Resume to encourage them to learn from mistakes. </p>

<p>I have taken and modified this same activity with the students in my Teen Entrepreneurship class. 10 slides with either a photo or single sentence describing failures they’ve experienced. I’ve encouraged them to think outside my class, outside school entirely. Failures can be academic, athletic, social, familial, entrepreneurial, etc.</p>

<p>When the students present, they will look at each experience and describe what they learned from it, or advise others on how to avoid doing the same. </p>

<p>A couple of students have shared their decks with me already, and I am eagerly anticipating presentation day. </p>

<p>Far too many of us are ashamed of past failures, swept under the rug in an attempt to divert attention. But showing how we have survived, and even learned from failure is a far greater testament to our character than success. Remember, it’s the before and after that matters, and failure is only permanent if you give up. </p>

<h2 id="if-youre-not-failing">If You’re Not Failing…</h2>

<p>If you’re not failing regularly, you’re not trying hard enough. You’re not giving yourself the chance to win. It’s time to develop a system to deal with failure. Anticipate it. Learn from it. Get better.</p>

<p>What’s on your Failure Resume? How has that helped you reach greater success?</p>
