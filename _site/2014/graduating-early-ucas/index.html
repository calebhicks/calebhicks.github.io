	<p>One of the <a href="http://www.uvu.edu/">local universities</a> offers a program where students can take concurrent enrollment classes that count towards both high school and general ed college credits. This is a great way to graduate high school with a transferable associate’s degree in tow. </p>

<p>I had a student ask me what I thought of the program. He is about to register for 10th grade and is considering applying to it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No way</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.ucas-edu.net/">UCAS</a> is a great program. Very successful students go through the program and exit high school two years ahead of their college-bound peers. It has a focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. All of which I strongly encourage students to take. So why wouldn’t I recommend it?</p>

<p>It’s simple. This kid is social, outgoing, and would miss some of the amazing opportunities high school offers. He would miss out on clubs, sporting events, dances, student government, and more. </p>

<p>High school isn’t for everyone. In fact, some very successful people skip right over it. But there are other ways to get ahead in schooling if that is the goal. </p>

<p>I graduated from my high school with nearly 45 credits under my belt. We had CP classes, similar to classes that offer AP credit, but without the required test. I also took half-days during my senior year to go down to the local universities and take classes. I didn’t have to go to a separate building two cities away from all of my friends and extra-curricular activities. And even though the first two years of high school were hard, my junior and senior years were some of the most fun of my life. </p>

<p>Rushing through college is a sucker’s game if you don’t know what you want to get out of it. I rushed to finish my degree. I had no clue what I wanted to do, I only knew that I wanted to graduate ASAP. </p>

<p>While I love my career choice, I fell into it rather than discovered it as a perfect fit for me. I didn’t take my time to find out what I wanted to do. I followed a trail set by a family of educators. Heck. I almost changed my major to accounting one semester before graduating in Business Education. (Happy to say I dodged a major bullet there.)</p>

<p>UCAS and other programs that help you get ahead are great if you know what you want to do with that degree. It’s a great way to save money on college tuition, and it can be a great fit if the typical high school scene just isn’t for you. To those students, I heartily endorse UCAS and similar programs. </p>

<p>But if you are the type of person who will get involved in clubs, dance, drama, student government; or if you enjoy getting to know new people, dating, dances, care-free drives with your friends; or if you just need a little more time to figure out who you are and what you want to become; find other ways to get ahead that allow you to still be a part of your high school. It just may be some of the best years of your life. </p>
