		<h1> <a href="/2014/watching-TV/"> It's OK to Watch TV</a></h1>
		<time datetime="2014-01-07T20:04:33Z">January 07, 2014</time>
	</header>
	<p>The stigma around watching TV during leisure time rubs me the wrong way. Somehow, enjoying TV in any capacity has become the villain of leading a happy, successful, productive life. I strongly disagree. Like any form of art, TV can enrich, enliven, even inspire. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did he just call TV an art form?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Art. The time, passion, sweat, and tears that go into creating some programs goes beyond that of the great classical books, music, and visual arts. </p>

<p>Of course, for every classic novel there are a thousand self-published pieces not worth your time. Similarly, there is a lot of cruft to dig through to uncover any great song, photo, or movie. Such is art. The truly great ones, the ones worth your time and intellectual investment, are rare. </p>

<p>I admit that TV can overtake too much time and mental energy. For some, it saps the brain of emotion and independent thought. I don’t write in support of zoning out, mindlessly spending your hours at the screen in the living room. </p>

<p>I write of those who heavily invest ourselves in our interests, who dive in to in a great storyline. Those whose brains race during a well-executed reveal, whose hearts rise and fall with the success and failures of top-shelf character development. </p>

<p>For those, watching TV isn’t passive, it exercises the mind. It isn’t shutting doors to the outside world, it opens new platforms for social discourse. </p>

<p>Just like a Shakespearian play, a Beethoven symphony, or a Dickensian Classic. </p>

<p>So don’t apologize because you take time away from work, side projects, or other endeavors to watch a show. You can be successful, happy, and productive, even if you watch TV. Perhaps more so, for enriching your life with the art of masters. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://jkhowland.me">Joshua Howland</a>, friend of the site, and a prolific self-taught developer, responded by e-mail this morning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think learning to program, writing a book, or shipping an app as a side project often comes at the cost of your leisure time. So sometimes I go months without TV. I sincerely think it’s a decrease in my quality of life when that happens. But we often have to sacrifice enjoyment in life to accomplish something creative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well put, and an excellent counterpoint to mine. Setting priorities is the key. Sacrificing leisure time in order to <a href="http://www.calebhicks.com/2014/hacer-ratio/">make more</a> is a worthy pursuit. We must find that fine balance between creating and overworking. One is a healthy endeavor, while the other induces stress and frustration.</p>

<p>In short, spend your time on what makes you happy and enriches your life.</p>

		<h1> <a href="/2014/graduating-early-ucas/"> The Argument for and Against Graduating Early With College Credit</a></h1>
		<time datetime="2014-01-06T19:18:59Z">January 06, 2014</time>
	</header>
	<p>One of the <a href="http://www.uvu.edu/">local universities</a> offers a program where students can take concurrent enrollment classes that count towards both high school and general ed college credits. This is a great way to graduate high school with a transferable associate’s degree in tow. </p>

<p>I had a student ask me what I thought of the program. He is about to register for 10th grade and is considering applying to it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No way</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.ucas-edu.net/">UCAS</a> is a great program. Very successful students go through the program and exit high school two years ahead of their college-bound peers. It has a focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math. All of which I strongly encourage students to take. So why wouldn’t I recommend it?</p>

<p>It’s simple. This kid is social, outgoing, and would miss some of the amazing opportunities high school offers. He would miss out on clubs, sporting events, dances, student government, and more. </p>

<p>High school isn’t for everyone. In fact, some very successful people skip right over it. But there are other ways to get ahead in schooling if that is the goal. </p>

<p>I graduated from my high school with nearly 45 credits under my belt. We had CP classes, similar to classes that offer AP credit, but without the required test. I also took half-days during my senior year to go down to the local universities and take classes. I didn’t have to go to a separate building two cities away from all of my friends and extra-curricular activities. And even though the first two years of high school were hard, my junior and senior years were some of the most fun of my life. </p>

<p>Rushing through college is a sucker’s game if you don’t know what you want to get out of it. I rushed to finish my degree. I had no clue what I wanted to do, I only knew that I wanted to graduate ASAP. </p>

<p>While I love my career choice, I fell into it rather than discovered it as a perfect fit for me. I didn’t take my time to find out what I wanted to do. I followed a trail set by a family of educators. Heck. I almost changed my major to accounting one semester before graduating in Business Education. (Happy to say I dodged a major bullet there.)</p>

<p>UCAS and other programs that help you get ahead are great if you know what you want to do with that degree. It’s a great way to save money on college tuition, and it can be a great fit if the typical high school scene just isn’t for you. To those students, I heartily endorse UCAS and similar programs. </p>

<p>But if you are the type of person who will get involved in clubs, dance, drama, student government; or if you enjoy getting to know new people, dating, dances, care-free drives with your friends; or if you just need a little more time to figure out who you are and what you want to become; find other ways to get ahead that allow you to still be a part of your high school. It just may be some of the best years of your life. </p>

		<h1> <a href="/2014/hacer-ratio/"> The Hacer Ratio</a></h1>
		<time datetime="2014-01-05T10:18:12Z">January 05, 2014</time>
	</header>
	<p><a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-builders-high/">Rands</a> has me pegged:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re swimming in everyone else’s moments, likes, and tweets and during these moments of consumption you are coming to believe that their brief interestingness to others makes it somehow relevant to you and worth your time… Each one you experience, each one you consume, is a moment of your life that you’ve spent forever… These are other people’s moments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve spent time reflecting on how I spend my time and if that reflects what I want my life to be. Too often, it doesn’t.</p>

<p>It is too easy to slip into my Twitter stream and feel like I accomplished something, or let an hour pass in Pocket on inconsequential moments.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about the Spanish word <em>hacer</em> lately. It’s an interesting word in that it has two distinct English translations. It means ‘to do’ <em>and</em> ‘to make’. So if I ask you ‘¿que estas haciendo?’ I am asking what you’re doing/making. I’ve been thinking about my life’s ratio of doing vs. making, or The Hacer Ratio.</p>

<p>How often am I <em>doing</em> something but not <em>making</em> something? And am I OK with that relationship?</p>

<p>Some things that I <em>do</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read through RSS feeds  </li>
  <li>Show up to school to teach  </li>
  <li>Watch TV with my wife  </li>
  <li>Listen to podcasts  </li>
  <li>Observe while my daughter plays  </li>
</ul>

<p>Things I’m not <em>making</em> when doing the above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing here, in my journal, or anywhere else  </li>
  <li>A difference to individual students, or my classes as a whole  </li>
  <li>A healthier, stronger marriage  </li>
  <li>Connections or new ideas that only come with a relaxed, undistracted brain  </li>
  <li>A strong, lasting relationship that enriches my life and pays dividends when my daughter is older  </li>
</ul>

<p>I find myself going through the motions, letting life happen to me instead of making mindful decisions. Too often I sit idly by <em>doing</em> things without consequence, instead of taking action to <em>make</em>.</p>

<p>I’m making changes around here. Eliminating distractions that enable <em>doing</em> and focusing on <em>making</em>. I am going for new addictive highs that come from building instead of observing. I am tipping the Hacer Ratio from <em>do</em> to <em>make</em>. </p>

<p>Hoy, que estas haciendo?<br />
What are you <em>making</em> today?</p>

		<h1> <a href="/2014/use-ipad-on-tmobile-free-200mb/"> Unlock Your iPad for Free Data on T-Mobile's 200MB/mo Plan</a></h1>
		<time datetime="2014-01-03T16:46:16Z">January 03, 2014</time>
	</header>
	<p>Beginning with the iPad Air in November of 2013, T-Mobile began offering a free 200MB/mo data plan for iPad owners.</p>

<p>While great for iPad Air owners, this is also exciting news because the same plan works on any LTE enabled iPad. The Verizon and AT&amp;T iPads both come unlocked, so all you have to do is get a T-Mobile SIM card to take advantage.</p>

<p>T-Mobile’s data is great in some areas, and not-so-great in most. But if you live in an area where T-Mobile has LTE or HSPA+, this is worth checking out.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/Clarify/unlock-your-ipad-for-free-data-on-t-mobile-s-200mb-mo-plan/Why-use-T-Mobile-for-data--sm.png" alt="T-Mobile data plan details for iPad Air" /></p>

<h2 id="step-1-order-a-t-mobile-sim-card">Step 1: Order a T-Mobile SIM Card</h2>

<p>First step is to pick up a T-Mobile SIM card. You can do so online at T-Mobile.com.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-phone/T-Mobile-Micro-SIM-Card-Activation-Kit-No-Annual-Contract">Micro SIM</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-phone/T-Mobile-Nano-SIM-Card-Prepaid">Nano SIM</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Check below to see which SIM card you need for your device, or view the <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5554">source Apple documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-replace-your-old-att-or-verizon-sim-card">Step 2: Replace Your Old AT&amp;T or Verizon SIM Card</h2>

<p>Our next step is to replace the AT&amp;T or Verizon SIM card with the new one from T-Mobile. Find a paperclip to eject the SIM card on your iPad casing.</p>

<p>Your iPad will notify you that there is No SIM Card Installed, as pictured:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/Clarify/unlock-your-ipad-for-free-data-on-t-mobile-s-200mb-mo-plan/Step-2--Replace-Your-Old-AT-T-or-Verizon-SIM-Card.png" alt="No SIM Card Installed" /></p>

<h2 id="step-3-insert-your-new-t-mobile-sim-card">Step 3: Insert Your New T-Mobile SIM Card</h2>

<p>Place the new T-Mobile SIM card into the tray and insert it into your iPad. Wait a few moments while the iPad activates the SIM card, and you’ll get a T-Mobile signal as pictured below.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/Clarify/unlock-your-ipad-for-free-data-on-t-mobile-s-200mb-mo-plan/Step-3--Insert-Your-New-T-Mobile-SIM-Card.png" alt="T-Mobile SIM Card activated" /></p>

<h2 id="step-4-set-up-your-t-mobile-sim-card-account">Step 4: Set Up Your T-Mobile SIM Card Account</h2>

<p>Open up Safari and navigate to any page. You will be redirected to the T-Mobile Mobile Internet Management account system. Set up a new account (FREE!), and you’ll be all set.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74616/Clarify/unlock-your-ipad-for-free-data-on-t-mobile-s-200mb-mo-plan/Step-4--Set-Up-Your-T-Mobile-SIM-Card-Account.png" alt="Set Up Your T-Mobile Account" /></p>

<h2 id="step-5-enjoy-your-free-200mbmo">Step 5: Enjoy Your Free 200MB/mo</h2>

<p>200MB/mo isn’t going to let you stream Netflix or Spotify, but it is plenty to check e-mail, Twitter, and surf the web when you don’t have Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>If you need more data, you can buy more from T-Mobile, or quickly swap your AT&amp;T or Verizon card back into the iPad and use either of those.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

		<h1> <a href="/2014/beyond-resolutions/"> Beyond Resolutions</a></h1>
		<time datetime="2014-01-01T11:09:23Z">January 01, 2014</time>
	</header>
	<p>We are not optimized for change, and resolutions based on a five minute brainstorm when the calendar flips won’t fix that. Writing down resolutions is a great start, but it’s just that, a start. It’s comparable to saying you’re going to run a marathon. You have to register for a race, make a training plan, and follow it for the duration, if you want to make it to an actual race, let alone stand a chance of running 26.2 miles. It requires concerted effort to create systems and design new habits into your life. </p>

<p>Regular people sit down around this time of year and write out a few things they hope get better in their lives. Most are lucky if they spend more than 15 minutes going through the ‘Resolution’ process.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I want to lose 15 pounds”</li>
  <li>“I’m going to keep my apartment clean”</li>
  <li>“I will go out on 25 dates with my wife”</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s that. The goals, if written down, end up in a drawer or in the garbage. And that is why most resolutions don’t work.</p>

<h2 id="taking-the-time">Taking the Time</h2>

<p>Chris Guillebeau writes a great series every December about his <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/category/annual-review/">Annual Review process</a>. He takes weeks to map out the year ahead, setting specific objectives, considering unexpected obstacles, planning for dependencies, and creating systems (we’ll get to systems in a minute) to make his vision a real possibility.</p>

<p>Chris’ annual review series is beyond the scope of this post, but if you want a great place to start with setting up for a great year, go read it.</p>

<p>The lesson learned from Chris is that he takes weeks, not minutes, to craft his vision for the year to come. Not everyone can do a multi-week planning session, but at the very least you can take a weekend.</p>

<h2 id="using-systems-to-improve-your-odds">Using Systems to Improve Your Odds</h2>

<p>High achievers use systems to improve their odds of success. Systems make up for our lack of willpower, and they are usually automated. The difference between a goal and a system is as follows:</p>

<h4 id="goal-i-want-to-save-10-of-my-income">Goal: I want to save 10% of my income</h4>

<h4 id="system-10-of-my-paycheck-is-automatically-deposited-into-a-separate-online-savings-account-each-month">System: 10% of my paycheck is automatically deposited into a separate online savings account each month</h4>

<p>See? I don’t have to want to save 10% of my income in August. I don’t have to log in to my bank’s website and move 10% over to my savings account. When I wake up on the 5th, 90% of my income is sitting in my checking account, and 10% is in a separate online savings account. </p>

<p>Total willpower required: none.</p>

<p>Research in behavioral change shows that information alone isn’t enough to motivate us. Researching weight loss doesn’t create a calorie deficit that burns fat. Learning about marathon training doesn’t tie your shoes and get your feet on the pavement. Having a list of resolutions <em>isn’t enough</em> to achieve them. </p>

<p>When you are designing your upcoming year, leave time to create systems that will eliminate the need for willpower. Automate as much as you can. Use tools like <a href="http://omnigroup.com/omnifocus">Omnifocus</a>, <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>, or <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> to manage projects, send reminders, or automate your computer contexts to help. </p>

<p>Let’s look at a few more examples of systems towards a specific goal:</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="goal-lost-15-pounds-by-august">Goal: Lost 15 pounds by August.</h4>

<p>This is a super common resolution, and one that most people fail year after year. What are some systems we can put in place that will eliminate the need for willpower to get this done?</p>

<h4 id="system-automate-food-and-activity-tracking">System: Automate food and activity tracking.</h4>

<p>Use a device like the Fitbit or Fuelband to automate activity tracking. You can set the devices to vibrate or alert you to milestones during the day. Sitting down for 20 minutes? Fuelband will tell you to get up and move. Play basketball with some friends? Fitbit keeps track and credits you for it.</p>

<p>You can use apps like My Fitness Pal to enter what you ate for each meal. Eliminate some of the required willpower for this by setting automatic reminders every 2 hours to enter anything you’ve eaten.</p>

<h4 id="system-hire-a-bi-weekly-personal-trainer-at-your-local-gym">System: Hire a bi-weekly personal trainer at your local gym.</h4>

<p>This eliminates required willpower by creating a commitment. You’ve now paid for the obligation to be at the gym at a specific time. You’ve also paid for the opportunity to feel super embarrassed if you don’t do anything to improve your health in between those bi-weekly visits.</p>

<h4 id="system-commit-with-a-friend-to-go-on-a-weekly-bike-ride-on-saturday-mornings">System: Commit with a friend to go on a weekly bike ride on Saturday mornings.</h4>

<p>You are making a personal commitment to be somewhere with someone important to you at a specific time. Odds are, you won’t unplug the alarm when it goes off at 7AM on Saturday.</p>

<h4 id="system-ask-your-server-to-box-half-of-your-meal-before-bringing-it-to-the-table-when-you-go-out-to-eat">System: Ask your server to box half of your meal before bringing it to the table when you go out to eat.</h4>

<p>How often do we eat because the food is sitting there in front of us? Eliminate the need for willpower by getting half of your meal boxed to go before you even sniff it. You’d feel foolish digging into your styrofoam box at the table, so you won’t do it.</p>

<hr />

<p>With 15 minutes extra minutes, you have a solid foundation to build on. The vague ‘Lose 15 pounds’ has now presented specific action items, many of which you can set up once and get repeated benefits down the line. Have you lost any weight because you thought through this? Not yet. But you now have a map instead of a destination.</p>

<h2 id="identify-new-habits-and-learn-how-to-build-them">Identify New Habits, and Learn How to Build Them</h2>

<p>It is useful to look at goals as building a new set of habits, but habits are hard to make (or break) for most people. When you are setting resolutions or goals, you must also look at the new habits that you need to make to achieve them. Then you can use a system to train yourself to do those habits.</p>

<p>BJ Fogg, a Stanford professor of behavioral psychology, has spent the last few years developing his Tiny Habits system. He gives a free online class each week teaching people how to create habits, and it works. I know what you’re thinking… “I don’t have time to take an entire class!” But the Tiny Habits ‘class’ takes 15 minutes to get started, and less than 3 minutes a day. In a nutshell, BJ teaches you to identify triggers and celebrate when you do the new habit you are trying to create.</p>

<p>I’m not kidding. It’s 15 minutes and 3 minutes a day. Go sign up at the <a href="http://tinyhabits.com">Tiny Habits</a> website. You’ll spend a whole lifetime building habits, so spend a week learning how to control which ones, so you can build the habits you want.</p>

<h2 id="in-resolution">In Resolution</h2>

<p>This isn’t meant to be a deep dive into setting goals. There are entire libraries dedicated to that. But I invite you to dig a little deeper.</p>

<p>Go beyond your New Years Resolutions. Spend the time to truly design the year that you want to have. Develop systems that take willpower out of the equation. Identify the habits required to reach your goal. Spend some time learning how habits work and how to develop the ones that you want. <em>That</em> will lead to success. </p>

<p>Have a Happy New Year, and much success.</p>
